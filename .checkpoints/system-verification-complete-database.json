        "summary": "The RFP for an AI-driven customer interaction chatbot involves significant AI-related risks primarily around regulatory compliance with GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and the EU AI Act. Key risks include data privacy and protection, governance and accountability, third-party vendor management, incident reporting, and AI system quality and bias mitigation. The complexity of integrating AI with sensitive insurance data and continuous self-learning capabilities heightens the risk profile.",
        "recommendations": "Establish a robust AI governance framework with clear accountability; conduct mandatory DPIAs prior to deployment; embed privacy-by-design and data minimization principles; implement comprehensive incident detection and reporting mechanisms; enforce strict third-party risk management and contractual controls; and maintain continuous AI system quality management including bias assessment and mitigation.",

The complexity of AI components such as NLP, automated response generation, and predictive analytics increases the likelihood of bias, data breaches, and non-compliance with GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and the EU AI Act. Without robust governance, technical controls, and operational processes, the platform risks severe penalties and reputational damage.",

These risks span governance, technical security, operational processes, and transparency, with strong regulatory compliance requirements under GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and the EU AI Act. The complexity of continuous learning and multi-channel deployment increases the likelihood of data breaches, bias, and operational failures.",
        "recommendations": "Establish a robust AI governance framework with clear accountability; conduct mandatory DPIAs before deployment; embed privacy-by-design and security-by-default principles; implement comprehensive incident reporting and breach notification processes; enforce strict third-party risk management for AI vendors; and maintain a quality management system with bias mitigation and continuous monitoring.",

These risks stem from the handling of personal data, integration complexity, continuous learning capabilities, and regulatory compliance obligations under GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and the EU AI Act. Without robust controls, the vendor risks non-compliance penalties, operational failures, and reputational damage.",
